🧩 Terraform AWS POC — EC2 + Nginx Webserver
📘 Overview

This Terraform Proof of Concept (POC) provisions a minimal AWS environment that includes:

A dedicated VPC with a public subnet

An Internet Gateway and route table for external access

A Security Group allowing HTTP (port 80) and ICMP

A t3.micro EC2 instance (Amazon Linux 2023)

User data boot script that installs and runs Nginx web server

Once deployed, Terraform outputs the public IP of the EC2 instance. You can visit this IP in your browser to see a test web page generated by the instance.

⚙️ Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed and configured on your local machine:

Tool	Version	Notes
Terraform
	v1.13.4 or later	Installed in user tools directory
AWS CLI
	v2.x	Configured with an AWS profile (aws configure)
PowerShell	v5 or higher	Used for running commands
🧰 Project Structure

├── main.tf           # VPC, Subnet, SG, EC2 Instance
├── provider.tf       # AWS provider configuration
├── variables.tf      # Input variables (profile, region, project name)
└── outputs.tf        # Terraform outputs (public IP, instance ID, AMI used)

🚀 Deployment Steps

Initialize Terraform

terraform init


Validate configuration

terraform validate


Preview the plan

terraform plan -out=tfplan


Apply the changes (create resources)

terraform apply "tfplan"


Check outputs

terraform output


Test in browser

Copy the public_ip output value.

Open http://<public_ip> in your browser — you should see the Nginx welcome page.

🧹 Cleanup

Destroy all AWS resources to avoid charges:

terraform destroy -auto-approve

🛡️ Notes

The AMI ID is dynamically fetched from AWS Systems Manager (SSM) for the latest Amazon Linux 2023 image.

Security Group allows port 80 from anywhere — for testing only.

Instance has no SSH key attached (cannot SSH in).

Change aws_profile and aws_region in variables.tf as needed.
